# Calculator Project

This project is a visually appealing, interactive, and functional calculator built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It was designed as part of a learning journey to strengthen web development skills.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Error Handling**: Displays clear messages for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero).
- **Interactive Design**: Button animations and dynamic display for user feedback.
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

1. **HTML**: Defines the structure and layout of the calculator.
2. **CSS**: Styles the interface with custom fonts, colors, and modern design aesthetics.
3. **JavaScript**: Implements the core logic and interactivity.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use `git clone <repository_url>` to download the project files.
2. **Open in Browser**: Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.
3. **Interact**: Click the buttons to input numbers and operations. The result is displayed dynamically on the output screen.

## File Structure

- **`index.html`**: Contains the layout of the calculator, including buttons and display screen.
- **`styles.css`**: Provides styling, including fonts, colors, and layout adjustments.
- **`interface.js`**: Manages user interactions, input handling, and arithmetic calculations.

## Project Highlights

- **Dynamic Output**: The display updates in real-time as the user interacts with the calculator.
- **Custom Font**: Integrates "EuroStyle Normal" for a sleek and modern appearance.
- **Accessibility**: Designed with clear color contrasts and interactive feedback.

## Future Enhancements

- Add keyboard input support for faster operation.
- Extend functionality to include scientific operations (e.g., square root, exponentiation).
- Improve responsiveness for smaller devices.
- Implement user-defined themes.
